Introduction:-

The Virtual Mouse project is an innovative application that allows users to control the cursor on their computer screen using 
hand gestures captured by a camera. It eliminates the need for a physical mouse and provides an alternative method of interaction,
ideal for accessibility purposes or touchless control.

Features:-

- Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects and interprets hand gestures to perform various mouse functions.
- Cursor Control: Move the cursor by simply pointing with your finger.
- Real-time Feedback: Provides real-time tracking and feedback on gesture recognition.

Technologies Used:-

- Python: The core programming language used for developing the application.
- OpenCV: For real-time computer vision and gesture detection.
- MediaPipe: To facilitate hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- PyAutoGUI: To simulate mouse movements and clicks.
- NumPy: For efficient array manipulation and numerical operations.
